# Criteria

In order to be accepted into this list, the company's interview process **must not** do the following in **any** step of the interview process:

- Ask CS trivia/brainteasers/riddles/puzzles/etc that DO NOT relate to the job the candidate is applying for
- Use live-coding sites like HackerRank or LeetCode

The only exceptions to the above is where CS knowledge is a **requirement** of the role. For example, if you are being hired to write a package manager, you probably need to understand DAGs.
