# Criteria

In order to be accepted into this list, the company's interview process **must not** do the following in **any** step of the interview process:

- Use CS/algorithmic questions/brainteasers/riddles/puzzles/etc that DO NOT relate to the job the candidate is applying for
- Use live-coding sites like HackerRank or LeetCode

The only exceptions to the above is where CS knowledge is a **requirement** of the role.

## Recommendations for companies that do "whiteboard" interviews

- Instead of using questions that bear no resemblance to the role, adapt the question so that it does. A screening question can be easily adapted so that it applies a "real world" requirement
- Take-home exercises can be good. Please try to:
  - time-box them (e.g. under 4 hours)
  - only allow use of stdlib
  - pay the candidate for their time
- Give the candidate options: Some candidates might not have the time necessary to complete a take-home exercise. In those scenarios, allow the candidate to take their laptop in to perform a shorter exercise (e.g. pair program on a small issue)
