## Removals

1. Read the following:
    - The use of the term "whiteboards" is metaphorical - if the interview calls for CS knowledge as a **requirement** (i.e. you require the knowledge to do your job), then it is OK
    - Screening questions that involve a CS question/brainteaser/puzzle are considered to be disqualifiers from being included in this list
1. Explain why the company does not fit the criteria
1. The PR will be merged assuming the guidelines are followed
1. The person who added the company will be given a chance to respond and add the company back if it does indeed **require** CS knowledge
