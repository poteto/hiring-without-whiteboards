### What is this?
This script basically parses the list and gets Alexa rankings of each company website.

#### Why does the Alexa rankings matter?
I think it is a good indicator of the reputation of the company.

### Usage
- Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

- Run the script
```
node alexa_rankings/get_rankings.js
```

This will create the updated version of output.json.
