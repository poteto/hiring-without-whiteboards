- [Detroit Labs](hhttps://www.detroitlabs.com/careers) | Detroit, MI | Our technical interview starts with a take-home assignment that we will look at during the interview. You'll walk us though your thought process, add functionality if applicable to the interview, and talk about your experience. We believe that showing us your work in a practical setting is more telling of your abilities and what you will bring to the table, than writing code on a whiteboard.
