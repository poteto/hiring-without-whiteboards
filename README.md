# Hiring Without Whiteboards

A listing of companies (or teams) that don't do "whiteboard" interviews. "Whiteboards" is used as a metaphor, and is a _symbol_ for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad ‚Äì CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode _probably_ fall into a similar category.

The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work ‚Äì for example pairing on a real world problem, or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) [our recommendations](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for ways to conduct better interviews.

### tl;dr
- Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is üëç
- Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is üëé
