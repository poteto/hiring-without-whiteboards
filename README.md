# Hiring without whiteboards
A listing of companies (or teams within companies) that don't do typical, CS based "whiteboard" interviews. Using sites like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) _probably_ fall into that category and won't be accepted. The companies and teams listed here instead use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work ‚Äì for example pairing on a real world problem, or a paid/unpaid takehome exercise.

### tl;dr
- Discussing a real world problem with the help of a whiteboard is üëç
- Solving basic CS questions, technical puzzles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is üëé

Please open a PR to be added.
